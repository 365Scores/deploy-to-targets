/**
 * <p>Describes one or more instance refreshes.</p>
 *         <p>You can determine the status of a request by looking at the <code>Status</code>
 *             parameter. The following are the possible statuses: </p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Pending</code> - The request was created, but the operation has not
 *                     started.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>InProgress</code> - The operation is in progress.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Successful</code> - The operation completed successfully.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Failed</code> - The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot
 *                     using the status reason and the scaling activities. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Cancelling</code> - An ongoing operation is being cancelled.
 *                     Cancellation does not roll back any replacements that have already been
 *                     completed, but it prevents new replacements from being started. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Cancelled</code> - The operation is cancelled. </p>
